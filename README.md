# Taboo [![Documentation Status][readthedocs-img]][readthedocs-url] [![Build Status][travis-img]][travis-url]
Blindly identify matching samples by comparing a limited set of genotypes.

## Scope
The project will be immediately usable internally at Clinical Genomics. The
functionality is general enough for other people to find it useful but I don't
intend to officially support external use any time soon.

## Install for development

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/taboo && cd taboo
$ pip install --editable .
```

## License
MIT. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.
